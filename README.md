# CTFs
pwn, re &amp; programming CTFs

I have solved some of them already so you might find exploits alerady embedded in some folders but you can just ignore them, only use them if you want, I can't stop you but it's more fun trying them out yourself.

And the numbers after the CTF names indicates how many points they are worth, the higher the number the harder the CTF (pretty simple)
