# AVL Programming Problem

## Overview

In this challenge, you will insert a series of nodes into an AVL tree. The flag will be derived from the rotations which will take place on nodes to keep the tree balanced after an insertion.

## Instructions

### Reading the Nodes

You have been provided with the file `nodes.txt` which contains the nodes which will be inserted into the AVL tree in the provided order. There is one node per line. Each node contains:

1. A positive integer, in decimal, acting as the key by which to sort the node into the tree
2. A single ASCII character which will be the node's stored data.

These two are comma-separated.

### Printing the Flag

The flag is generated by printing out a node's data field when its insertion into the tree requires more than one rotation to occur in order to keep the AVL tree balanced. These printed ASCII data fields should then be submitted between the normal flag braces: `CWE{...DATA...}`.

## Scoring

As always when preparing your write-up, you will be evaluated based on the following software engineering pillars:

- Correctness (printing the flag)
- Safe from bugs (handles bad input without crashing)
- Easy to understand (commented and intuitive program structure)
- Ready for change (modular implementation)
- Adherence to the [Google C Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
